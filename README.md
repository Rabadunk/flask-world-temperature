# FLASK world temperature app
A web app made using Flask that shows the temperature given a city and a country. I made this following a flask tutorial by PrettyPrinted who used US postal codes the display temperature instead. You can find his video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbYXa6HJJ5M.

## Website

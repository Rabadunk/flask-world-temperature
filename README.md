# FLASK world temperature app
A web app made using Flask that shows the temperature given a city and a country. I made this following a flask tutorial by PrettyPrinted who used US postal codes the display temperature instead. You can find his video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbYXa6HJJ5M.

## Website
There are still alot of bugs and what not with this site but I wanted to try host a flask application on https://www.pythonanywhere.com.
Heres the link: http://rabadunk.pythonanywhere.com/

## Updates

Currently the website looks really unaesthetic with low level funcitonality. I really want to change how it looks as it's way too plain and also the way it works because people dont enter city and country name to find weather on that place. Also the website doesn't handle errors very well.
